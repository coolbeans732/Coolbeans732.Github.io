      <h3>Faith Over Fear</h3>
      <p>“When I am afraid, I put my trust in you.” — Psalm 56:3</p>
      <p>Fear can freeze us in place, but faith propels us forward. Today, take one small step in faith and trust God’s plan even if you can’t see the full picture.</p>

      <h3>God’s Timing</h3>
      <p>“There is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens.” — Ecclesiastes 3:1</p>
      <p>Waiting is hard, but God's timing is always right. Use this time to grow, pray, and prepare for what’s ahead.</p>

      <h3>Identity in Christ</h3>
      <p>“I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made.” — Psalm 139:14</p>
