      <h3>🌱 Staying Rooted in God's Word</h3>
      <p><strong>Scripture:</strong> Psalm 1:2-3</p>
      <p>“But whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law day and night… whatever they do prospers.”</p>
      <p><em>Reflection:</em> A strong tree thrives because of deep roots. In the same way, a strong faith thrives by staying rooted in Scripture daily.</p>
